## Interview Scripts

### The following is a compilation of the interview interactions conducted for Part-II of the project. The interviewees had different approaches to answers and
### also varying backgrounds.


## Timothy Naudet - Chemistry Major at WestPoint Military Academy

### Questions asked BEFORE the Storyboard and Wireframes are shown -

1. Do you have an economics or finance background? <br>

Not really, I have taken two basic Economics Courses at CMU, nothing other than that.

2. How much do you know about Inflation in general and it's causes? <br>

Not more than an average person.

3. Would you consider it an important aspect of your life or something that could be troublesome enough for everyone to think about it?<br>

Probably yes.



### Questions asked AFTER the Storyboard and Wireframes are shown - <br>

1. Does the story give you new insights and information that you weren't familiar with before?<br> 
Not really, I'm familiar with most concepts but actual statistics were interesting.<br>

2. Does this story compel you to think more about Inflation? <br>
Yes, the coffee visual made me think that inflation is actually scary.The balloon sketch is really cool, emphasises the FIAT concept.<br>

3. Will this story persuade you to be more wary and attentive towards Inflation?<br> 
Ideally, I'd want to say yes but realistically I know I won't think about it unless I'm making an investment decision. Any specific answer is misleading.<br>

4. Were some aspects confusing or not as intuitive as you'd have liked them to be? <br>

Yeah, the coffee graph doesn't have a unit mentioned, so it would be better if I knew what exactly the amount is for this price. (I then showed him the subtext at the bottom)Oh, it would be better if it said so in the title. Also, the savings bar chart would be more helpful to me if it had +10 years , +20 years or something like that would make the topic more coherent? It was all pretty straightforward. The balloon diagram captures the essence of FIAT.<br>

5. Could the charts and infographics have been presented in some other way to make them more coherent and compelling?<br>
Everything is right on, except if you could add units to the other diagram. Other than that I think it is very very good and easy to read. No conflicts.<br>

#### Extra Question - Do the call to actions seem helpful?<br>
Sort of.

## Vaishali Shukla -  Undergrad in Electronics and Communication Engineering

### Questions asked BEFORE the Storyboard and Wireframes are shown -

1. Do you have an economics or finance background? <br>
No, nothing.<br>

2 .How much do you know about Inflation in general and it's causes? <br>
Not much but I do know certain things, the reason being I'm living in India and after the COVID crisis we can actually feel it.<br>


3. Would you consider it an important aspect of your life or something that could be troublesome enough for everyone to think about it?<br>
Obviously, economic conditions force people to think of their financial standings and they should look at inflation when talking about these things.<br>

### Questions asked AFTER the Storyboard and Wireframes are shown -<br>

1. Does the story give you new insights and information that you weren't familiar with before?<br> 
Some points were familiar but some points such as the US printing so much money and its relation to inflation is new to me. 
Also the relative percentage is shocking.<br>

2. Does this story compel you to think more about Inflation? <br>
Not really, but it does make me think about future plans.<br>

3. Will this story persuade you to be more wary and attentive towards Inflation?<br> 
Exactly what I said above, it makes me worry about future plans and retirement savings.<br>

4. Were some aspects confusing or not as intuitive as you'd have liked them to be? <br>
The gold standard cartoon is great but you should've provided some context to it. Not everyone knows about it's meaning. Even I just know that the Reserve Bank of India
prints according to it's gold reserves, does the US not do that? Try to explain why printing at will is not okay.<br>

5. Could the charts and infographics have been presented in some other way to make the topic more coherent?<br>
The pie chart is perfect but the first graph is about government policy and inflation? (This was wrongly interpreted by most people, they thought it is printing vs inflation data
whereas it is a Google Search Trend) Also your hand drawn graph on the story page is difficult to understand.<br>

## Cameron T. - Investment Banker/Final Year MBA Student at Tepper School of Business

### Questions asked BEFORE the Storyboard and Wireframes are shown -<br>

1. Do you have an economics or finance background? <br>
I do, I have an Undergrad in Finance, worked in an investment bank and now doing an MBA in Finance as well.<br>

2. How much do you know about Inflation in general and it's causes? <br>
I mean, I track it as an investment professional because it impacts how you view your portfolio returns. I'm familiar with the tracking mechanisms such as CPI, PCD. I wouldn't call myself an expert. (He is an expert).<br>


3. Would you consider it an important aspect of your life or something that could be troublesome enough for everyone to think about it?<br>
People should surely pay attention to it, especially when they think of wealth generation and how they allocate their money. (Proceeds to give actual quantitaive examples)Also in general how consumer goods prices rises, they affect everyone.<br>

### Questions asked AFTER the Storyboard and Wireframes are shown -<br>

1. Does the story give you new insights and information that you weren't familiar with before?<br> 
Is coffee actually getting so expensive? That's insane. My Starbucks budget looks in trouble, but they probably won't increase prices because they lock in their futures much earlier. I haven't tracked individual commodity prices, so that was surprising. The dollars printed pie chart was also new to me but you should keep in mind they might be nominal values and not inflation adjusted, so this looks more dramatic than it is.<br>


2. Does this story compel you to think more about Inflation? <br>
(Not applicable to him really) I will still be paying the same amount of attention.<br>

3. Will this story persuade you to be more wary and attentive towards Inflation?<br> 
(Aready is)

4. Were some aspects confusing or not as intuitive as you'd have liked them to be? <br>
When the first visual says the Federal Reserve System what is it referring to? (I explain it) Okay you might have to make it more clear, add a title or something.
Make the gold standard visual more verbose and might have to talk about when this happened and all.

5. Could the charts and infographics have been presented in some other way to make the topic more coherent?<br>
If you showed the buckets of inflation it might be useful but that might be too technical for others, I think of it through an investing perspective so maybe just my
thoughts.<br>
