# Inflation: Project Part-II


## Refinements from Part-I

The Part-I of the project was more or less based on Monetary Policies and how actions of certain Institutions lead to detrimental economic conditions. This engulfed a whole range of sub-topics that by themselves are worthy of detailed discussion or become individual projects. Frankly, this would've required a 12 hour economics recap to grasp the context and essence of most aspects of the story. I noticed this problem when I tried to explain the project scope to classmates who were puzzled and felt this was all slightly overwhelming. 

Which is why I've now refined the project to focus on just 'Inflation' that is the ultimate consequence of all other economic actions (and those unreallistically long sub topics in Project Part-I).

The Part-II of will discuss Inflation in the following breakdown - <br>

1. Background
2. What is Inflation?
3. What causes Inflation?
4. How Does it Affect You?
5. Why Should You Care Now?
6. How To Be Aware and Beat Inflation?
<br>

The structure described above is meant for a general purpose audience with varying backgrounds. Hence, instead of being laden with jargon and complex structures, the project will now take readers on a journey to understand inflation and how they can overcoe=me it's adverse effects.

## User Research

### Questions asked BEFORE the Storyboard and Wireframes are shown -
  
1. Do you have an economics or finance background? <br>
2. How much do you know about Inflation in General and it's causes? <br>
3. Would you consider it an important aspect of your life or something that could be troublesome enough for everyone to think about it?

### Questions asked AFTER the Storyboard and Wireframes are shown -

1. Does the story give you new insights and information that you weren't familiar with before? <br>
2. Does this story compel you to think more about Inflation? <br>
3. Will this story persuade you to be more wary and attentive towards Inflation? <br>
4. Were some aspects confusing or not as intuitive as you'd have liked them to be? <br>
5. Could the charts and infographics have been presented in some other way to make the topic more coherent?<br>
  

### Findings

  <p> I've learn that my visuals need more titles and context to them and some such as the gold standard ones need more supporting arguments. Overall the users did
    seem aware of some aspects of inflation but were not familiar with the statistics, causes and perpetrators of the same.</p>
  
  <p> For Part-III, I intend to make the visuals more verbose and add a wow factor type of viz through Raw.IO </p>
