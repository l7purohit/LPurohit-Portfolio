# Inflation: Project Part-II


## Refinements from Part-I

The Part-I of the project was more or less based on Monetary Policies and how actions of certain Institutions lead to detrimental economic conditions. This engulfed a whole range of sub-topics that by themselves are worthy of detailed discussion or become individual projects. Frankly, this would've required a 12 hour economics recap to grasp the context and essence of most aspects of the story. I noticed this problem when I tried to explain the project scope to classmates who were puzzled and felt this was all slightly overwhelming. 

Which is why I've now refined the project to focus on just 'Inflation' that is the ultimate consequence of all other economic actions (and those unreallistically long sub topics in Project Part-I).

The Part-II of will discuss Inflation in the following breakdown - <br>

1. Background
2. What is Inflation?
3. What causes Inflation?
4. How Does it Affect You?
5. Why Should You Care Now?
6. How To Be Aware and Beat Inflation?
<br>

The structure described above is meant for a general purpose audience with varying backgrounds. Hence, instead of being laden with jargon and complex structures, the project will now take readers on a journey to understand inflation and how they can overcoe=me it's adverse effects.

## User Research
  
<p> As the direction and objective of the project have changed, it was necessary to find relevant interviewees. I chose a set of people that all had differenteducational backgrounds and roles. - An extreme user (Finance MBA), a professor (unavailable finally), a Chemistry background military person, and an undergraduate engineering student. The users were first asked basic questions to establish a background, then shown the Storyboard and Wireframes, and finally posed contextual/feedback questions.</p>,<br>


### Questions asked BEFORE the Storyboard and Wireframes are shown -
  
1. Do you have an economics or finance background? <br>
2. How much do you know about Inflation in General and it's causes? <br>
3. Would you consider it an important aspect of your life or something that could be troublesome enough for everyone to think about it?

### Questions asked AFTER the Storyboard and Wireframes are shown -

1. Does the story give you new insights and information that you weren't familiar with before? <br>
2. Does this story compel you to think more about Inflation? <br>
3. Will this story persuade you to be more wary and attentive towards Inflation? <br>
4. Were some aspects confusing or not as intuitive as you'd have liked them to be? <br>
5. Could the charts and infographics have been presented in some other way to make the topic more coherent?<br>
  
### [Detailed Interview Extracts](/Interview_Extracts.md)

### Findings -

<p>I have learned that people do know about Inflation up to a certain level. They may not be aware of the details w.r.t to causes, how it directly affects the general public and perpetrators. However, they do understand
what it is at a basic level. Interestingly, while most of them knew, they did not care enough to think about it actively. They were surprised by the statistics and thought Inflation should be an essential factor while actively making investment decisions. </p>

<p>  
The visual feedback was enlightening, some of it was background specific, and I had never looked from those perspectives. However, the Google Search trend was consistently confusing for everyone. I have to make sure it is well described and titled. A user even pointed out that the 'Coffee Futures' chart had no unit, so it didn't help him understand how much coffee these prices reflected. Another consistent theme was the Gold Standard cartoon; though most of them knew what it meant, they still felt it had to be more verbose and descriptive. Most people liked the 'Printing Money' pie chart because it was new to them, but an extreme user also mildly criticized it. Finally, the hand-drawn money supply chart seems obscure as no one even mentioned it. I should find a way to make it more visible and attention-seeking</p>

<p>Overall I feel that the project has achieved its goal of being a simple version of Part-I, and now I need to maybe add some 'Wow' factors to it.</p>
