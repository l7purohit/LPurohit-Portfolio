# Monetary System - and a Tax You Never Knew About

## Project Outline

This section of the project has the components or key issues of the topic that I'd like to cover. It is an exhaustive list that I eventually intend to trim and 
tie down together (keep what is necessary) with supporting data and visualisations. 

My project revolves around Inflation which itself is a consequence of a goverment's monetary policy. The project intends to educate a general audience on how they
are unknowingly victims to a bad monetary policy that keeps pushing problems to a later date, while middle and lower sections of society battle the effects of it regularly and unknowingly.


What it is?
How it is being done?
Why it is done?
The key events in history that have triggered this?
Perpetrators?

I plan to discuss the origin and reason for existence of currency, then proceed to how it has evolved, followed by discussing the government's role in its evolution, the key events in history that have had an impact, the effects on the general public's life. If time permits and the story has space for more, I'd like to also explore the birth of cryptocurrency influenced by people losing trust in the status quo monetary system.

## Sketches

Here are a few sketches that will attempt to present the information required and mentioned above (not necessarily in order). There are other sections such as - 
Consumer Price Index, Effects on Income Groups that I will need to research and identofy key pointers further before making an attempt
at visualising that data.

## Data

This list of data sources includes references to sections from the Project Outline (hyperlink this) that it may correspond to.

I have extracted data from reliable sources like OECD, FRED and the Federal Reserves official page itself. All these sources have CSV files which
will facilitate the data viz conception process for me. 

The data from OECD will be used to compare federal reported Inflation and Real Inflation and try to highlight the reason for discrepancies in
the distinct reportings. Similarly, data from Measuring Worth will be used to draw a parallel between Gold Prices, before and after the Nixon
Act as well as its comparison of value to the USD [Statista]. The federal balance sheet data will help visualise the increase in their assets
and why it is a bad thing, with componential breakdowns. Also Measuring Worth's GDP datast will be used to compare the money supply in a time
series and depict how the two that are meant to be shadowing each other, are no longer in sync.
