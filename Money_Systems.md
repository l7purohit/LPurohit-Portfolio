# Monetary System - and a Tax You Never Knew About

## Project Outline

This section of the project has the components or critical issues of the topic I'd like to cover. It is an exhaustive list that I eventually intend to trim and 
tie down together (keep what is necessary) with supporting data and visualizations. 

My project revolves around Inflation which itself is a consequence of a government's monetary policy. The project intends to educate a general audience on how they are unknowingly victims to a bad economic policy that keeps pushing problems to a later date, while middle and lower sections of society battle the effects of it regularly and unknowingly.


What it is?
How it is being done?
Why it is done?
The critical events in history that have triggered this?
Perpetrators?

I plan to discuss the origin and reason for the existence of currency, then proceed to how it has evolved, then discuss the government's role in its evolution, the key events in history that have had an impact, the effects on the general public's life. Finally, if time permits and the story has space for more, I'd like to explore the birth of Cryptocurrency influenced by people losing trust in the status quo monetary system.


### Elements

1. What is money?
2. Problem with Current Monetary Policy
3. The Gold Standard & Nixon 1971
4. Money Supply (viz)
5. Inflation Rates (viz)
6. CPI Index (viz) Is it trustworthy?
7. Effects of Inflation (viz)
8. Why the government inflates?
9. Taxes are the government's income; no politician raises taxes to look popular
10. Money printed in 2020 (viz)
11. Fed Balance Sheet (viz)
12. Concept of Cryptocurrency
13. Federal Deficit (viz)
14. Biggest Ponzi Scheme of all time
15. Losers and Winners
16. How do they Inflate?
17. Economic Output vs. Money Supply (viz)



## Sketches

Here are a few sketches that will attempt to present the required information mentioned above (not necessarily in order). There are other sections such as - 
Consumer Price Index, Effects on Income Groups that I will need to research and identify key pointers further before making an attempt
at visualizing that data.

## Data

This list of data sources includes references to sections from the Project Outline (hyperlink this) that it may correspond to.

I have extracted data from reliable sources like OECD, FRED, and the Federal Reserves' official page itself. All these sources have CSV files which
will facilitate the data viz conception process for me. 

The data from the OECD will be used to compare reported federal Inflation and Real Inflation and highlight the reason for discrepancies in
the distinct reportings. Similarly, data from Measuring Worth will be used to draw a parallel between Gold Prices before and after the Nixon
Act as well as its comparison of value to the USD [Statista]. The federal balance sheet data will help visualize the increase in their assets
and why it is bad, with componential breakdowns. Also, Measuring Worth's GDP dataset will compare the money supply in a time
series and depict how the two that are meant to be shadowing each other are no longer in sync.

## Medium

This story will need a lot of visuals that are not necessarily derived from datasets, text data to explain proceedings, and a few short videos. To best incorporate these different elements with Data Visuals, I would be using shorthand.

I will begin writing a script and part by part segregation of the whole story from this stage onwards. Each piece will try to have a text a non-dataset
visual and then finally a data visualization. Once I attempt that stage while following up with a script, I'll identify what is working - what is not, essential arcs - disposable arcs. This process will also help realize whether the data visualizations are persuasive enough to corroborate the story arc.

I intend to draw parallels with dynamic 'line race charts' for things like Economic Output vs. Money Circulation; Bitcoin and Traditional Gold (why they are a hedge against Fiat Money etc. To show proportional increases - Area Line Chart, TreeMaps, and Stacked Bar Chart for elements like the Fed Reserve Balance Sheet. Finally, to make the Shorthand project enjoyable - I plan to include the Nixon Press conference (short clip) and insert a visual that emphasizes the vicious circular relationship between the treasury and the federal reserve.

In the end, as part of the call to action - I will show the different taxation policies of politicians compared to the budget deficits and money printing to show
why a politician's refusal to increase taxes and instead increase debt to maintain popularity is harmful to countries and the world economy in the long run. Also, Cryptocurrency might feature at this point to draw a parallel between it and gold (through data) and urge people to force politicians to make difficult choices such as revising the currency system to be backed by a tangible, scarce underlying asset.
