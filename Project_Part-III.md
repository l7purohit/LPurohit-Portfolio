# Part III

## Audience

After the Part 2 user research, I decided that my target audience would be 'The General Public'. My aim now was to share information with them that might be known to some and not to the others yet add that with some statistics that would generate intrigue. To keep the context of this presentation relevant I also realized that my audience is not your bunch of average Joes but students with master’s degrees. They would not be fazed by slightly complex graphs and would rather see something interesting than be presented with boring stuff.

This was the reason that I decided to not cut down the Gold Standard, Money Supply vs GDP and Google Trends graphic but rather enhance them. They would be attractive and cover a concept that some might not be aware of.

I also learned in my user feedbacks that some charts did not clarify what exactly the units and context was. Hence, I added descriptive details as subtitles to the Google Search Trend viz and specified the Coffee Future’s Trading units more explicitly.

My audience also pointed out a use of lot of colors, so I had to keep that in my mind.

The M1 Money Supply was written down as just Money Supply to help readers understand it faster and not get caught up in technicalities. I did mention this maneuver in the footnote to not come off as misleading. This was a good way to help the story flow and was approved by my instructor.

## Summary

This project started out with a very complex and broad scope. I was too ambitious and wanted to share all that I felt was wrong with the monetary system with my audiences. When I spoke to Prof. Goransson and tried to share my idea with classmates in the initial phases; I realized that though it might be a good story it does not go well as a ‘data story’ because there are too many aspects that would require tying in. 

With repeated iterations and a lot of conversation with Professor, I was able to bring it down to what would matter and impact my audience the most. The challenge then was to simplify it but keep it interesting at the same time. I used a lot of infograms to maintain user engagement and even a funny GIF to hit home the point of Federal printing. I tried hand drawing visuals, pull some data that could be wrangled to exploit exactly instances that support my argument, and provide a call of action that wasn’t generic but also wouldn’t project myself as an SME on this subject. 

The designs took a lot of time, I started with the wireframes that looked good but were all over the place.  Next, I made the storyboard that was more structured, but colors and themes were haphazard and looked like a coloring book. Eventually, through repeated iterations I could clear my thought process, and use the Dollar theme itself.  Off-white, Dark Green, Light Green and Black, the colors of the USD bill itself. In fact, to double down on visual impression I even wore a dark green polo to the presentation and reinforce perception or the theme.

Overall, I believe, this project has taught me that visualization has a lot of noise. Identifying it and cutting down to exactly what the users need is an art, whether I succeeded at it with my project or not is a different story. The environment and invisible elements/work that needs to be put in for a Data Story is not an easy job. Though, I did not get a chance to play around with peculiar data visual types such as Radars and Tree Maps because of the nature of my data, I really liked learning from my classmates through their projects. 

Even if this project did not make me a data viz expert, the least I would have learnt is to identify what elements makes a good visualization, what are the components of a coherent story and what not to do in a data visualization!
