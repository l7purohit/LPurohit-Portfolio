# Assignment 3&4

This assignment involved choosing a data visualisation that had its underlying dataset available and first critiquing it. After that, I was supposed to wireframe potential solutions that followed my critique suggestions and then test the effectiveness by demonstrating them to others. The next step  was taking feedback after which I set out to build the solution. Here's my journey or I'd rather say thought process documented in text and visuals -

## The Original Visualisation

I came across this visualisation on [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/620805/smartphone-sales-market-share-in-the-us-by-vendor/)

## Critique Phase

After choosing the visualization, I realized that although it has its flaws, it delivers a lot of information in one chart. Which depending on the context during certain times, makes sense. Furthermore, the guide scale provided to rate the viz made me realize that it does complete its objective (hence decently rated) to deliver the required information truthfully.  What it lacked was engagement, peculiarity to intrigue the reader, and visual aesthetics. 

The font-weight for different elements can be optimized, color scheme bettered, and labeling - reduced and reorganized. Although a certain level of interaction is provided for the chart (it would have worked in its favor if properly implemented), I also intend to make one interactive or dynamic visualization. Also, the content type, i.e., a market share comparison displayed, might be better suited to a different form of visualization, such as a pie chart, doughnut, or race graphs. A combination of plain and dynamic might attract readers of all kinds.

I decided to experiment with those mentioned above in my wireframes.

## Wireframes

I went through different chart types on many websites, but all looked pretty simple and plain. I then stumbled upon Pictionary Bar Charts on DVP and felt an 'aha' moment. However, after exploring it a little, I realized it might not be customizable to the idea I have in mind. 

So I went ahead and sketched something I'd have liked to be on an iPad.

I tried to draw a phone with the visualizations inside it. However, when I saw the original chart, I felt it had too much information stuffed. I drew five separate components (as phones) to fix this, and each phone represented a year. The visual inside is a horizontally stacked chart for Q1 of every year. At the top, the arrow depicts a dropdown button that enables to switch quarters.

When I finished my wireframe, I did not realize that a reader of this visual might not figure out a dropdown menu at the top, which was obvious considering my artistic skills.

## Testing the Solutions

### 1st Participant - Himanshu (Flatmate) - IT Background

Can you tell me what you think this is?
	It looks like a market share chart.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
	Yes, it is a time series of these major companies' positions in the market. It is badly drawn, though.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
	Yes, the color size or bars do not accurately match up to the % written in them. Also, is that box supposed to be a phone? 

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
	The company executives mentioned here or anyone else such as market researchers.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
	The phone aspect doesn't look so at first glance, and because it is handwritten, I have difficulty understanding the numbers.


After showing the wireframes to the first person, I realized I might have to show them the sketch and a digital wireframe to get opinions on multiple options. I went ahead and tried some things on Infogram -

### 2nd Participant - Shampock (Heinz Student) - Art Background

***Can you tell me what you think these are?***<br>
	Yes, smartphone selling quantities. Are they all different visuals or one?

***Can you describe to me what this is telling you?***<br>
	Yearly review of this data or quarterly breakdown.

***Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?***<br>
	In the phone thing, is that only one quarter or all quarters aggregated? Also, it isn't easy to read percentages in both the handwritten one and digital bar chart example.

***Who do you think is the intended audience for this?***<br>
	Probably, these companies. Who else would be interested in so many bars and for so many instances?

***Is there anything you would change or do differently?***<br>
	The sketched one is occupying screen space weirdly; there seem to be uneven areas allocated to the bars.

### Reflection

After listening to the two participants, it was confirmed that people want to see clear distinctions to help them judge without reading numbers when presented with market data. Bar charts are not so attractive to a general audience. Instead, both participants believed it was meant for internal company reviews.

I want the visual to engage a general audience and be informative enough to help make conclusions for a  professional audience.

The doughnut chart idea had to be eliminated because, while it may be informative for a general audience, a board of directors would not take the trouble to go and change quarters in 4 different phones repeatedly to make comparisons; they need to see the broad picture in one go.
