Hi! I'm Lakshya Purohit and my pronouns are he/him. I'm currently pursuing a Masters at Carnegie Mellon University and this portfolio was created to work on an interesting course called 'Telling Stories with Data'. The name and style of this class are peculiar but my other data analytical courses are plain, simple and as an outsider would say 'boring'. I am a tech enthusiast and I like reading about the applications of technology to real world problems. From Apple's unified ecosystem vision to ASML's monopoly in Semi Conductor Manufacturing , I like to learn it all!

When I'm away from academics and professional duties, it's either football (Soccer in America) or travelling for me. Until now, I've lived, adapted and worked in 4 different countries on 4 different continents and travelled to 9 others, the experiences have broadened my horizons.


# What I hope to Learn
The reason I took this course is to learn how to make data interesting and engaging enough to visually hook an audience; Stories are engaging. I hope to grasp through this course the skill to understand the underlying subtleties involved in transforming that data to a compelling but truthful narrative. Other things that I am looking foward to in this course are - hands on with tools like Tableau, Shorthand; critiquing existing visuals from different sources and understanding how they are manipulated to push an opinion; development of this portfolio that will later give my other projects an aesthetic, visual dimension.

Post graduation, I intend to work as a consultant and provide solutions on client cases through analytics. Eventually I want to build a company that relies on its 
insight generation power to excel in any sector, be it Mining, FMCG or Hospitality.
