Hi! I'm Lakshya Purohit and my pronouns are he/him. I'm currently pursuing a Masters at Carnegie Mellon University and this portfolio was created to work on an interesting course called 'Telling Stories with Data'. The name and style of this class are peculiar but my other data analytical courses are plain, simple and as an outsider would say 'boring'. I am a tech enthusiast and I like reading about the applications of technology to real world problems. From Apple's unified ecosystem vision to ASML's monopoly in Semi Conductor Manufacturing , I like to learn it all!

When I'm away from academics and professional duties, it's either football (Soccer in America) or travelling for me. Until now, I've lived, adapted and worked in 4 different countries on 4 different continents and travelled to 9 others, the experiences have broadened my horizons.


# What I hope to Learn
The reason I took this course is to learn how to make data interesting and engaging enough to visually hook an audience; Stories are engaging. I hope to grasp through this course the skill to understand the underlying subtleties involved in transforming that data to a compelling but truthful narrative. Other things that I am looking foward to in this course are - hands on with tools like Tableau, Shorthand; critiquing existing visuals from different sources and understanding how they are manipulated to push an opinion; development of this portfolio that will later give my other projects an aesthetic, visual dimension.

Post graduation, I intend to work as a consultant and provide solutions on client cases through analytics. Eventually I want to build a company that relies on its 
insight generation power to excel in any sector, be it Mining, FMCG or Hospitality.

### Debt as % of GDP

#### Viz-1 through the OECD Website

#### Viz-2 through Flourish

The following Visualisation individually maps out each country's debt as a % of their GDP. In the majority of cases the debt is increasing at faster pace than the GDP, whic is a worrying trend when put in terms with economic output measurement. Apart from a few exceptions, it can be observed that the most increase and high percentages are for developed countries like Japan, USA, Canada and Italy.

#### Viz-3

### Debt to GDP Ratio for OECD Countries

This interactive treemap gives annual comparisons of Debt/GDP Ratio and clearly highlights the countries that have the worst and best GDP ratio among the OECD. Japan consistently has a bad ratio and from the early 2000s onwards Greece's well documented economic crisis is visible in the map before it finally overtakes Japan in 2019 as the worst performer. The USA had it's worst position in 2011.

The color scheme for this visual is Flourish's dark theme which doesn't attract too much attention towards particular elements. (In a treemap, multiple colors are hard to avoid but because they serve a prupose it would be not wise to reduce them)

#### Comparison of Visuals

The treemap is a great option to compare and contrast countries side by side for individual years. The grid chart provides a different insight allowing us to compare each country's perfomance in a vacuum over 25 years. Whereas the treemap stacks the countries against one another and is more sizable and intuitive than a bar chart. In a treemap the smallest elements are to the right and bottom, which is exacly how our eyes travel and the brain prioritises information. 

##### Source Information

The OECD is Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD maintains various statistical measures for each of it's member countries. The data for these visualisations is courtesy of the CSV File available on - [General Government Debt](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm)
